# Surah 101: Al Qari’a (The Striking Calamity / The Great Disaster.): Makkah

## What Allah Says in this Surah

- In the Surah, Allah describes the Striking Calamity, a term for the Day of Judgment. He poses a rhetorical question to emphasize the severity and significance of this event: "What is the Striking Calamity?" and "What can make you know what is the Striking Calamity?"
- Allah explains that on this day, people will be like scattered moths, illustrating the widespread chaos and confusion. The mountains, usually symbols of stability, will be like fluffed-up wool, showing the complete disintegration of the natural world.
- Then, Allah discusses the fate of individuals based on their deeds. Those whose scales are heavy with good deeds will enjoy a pleasant life in paradise. Conversely, those whose scales are light will find their refuge in an abyss. To emphasize the horror of this fate, Allah again uses a rhetorical question: "And what can make you know what that is?" He answers that it is a Fire, intensely hot, highlighting the severe punishment for those lacking good deeds.

## Dua

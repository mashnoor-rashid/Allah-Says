# Welcome to Allah Says

This channel is dedicated to exploring the deep wisdom and guidance found in the Qur'an, the holy book of Islam. Here, we aim to understand the words of Allah and uncover His messages for humankind.

Allah emphasizes the importance of the Qur'an through verses like:

I have made the Qur'an easy to understand. So, is there anyone who will think about it?- Surah Al-Qamar 54:17,22,32,40

Indeed, the Qur'an is the criterion between truth and falsehood. - Surah-At-Tariq 86:13

So, do they not deeply think about the Qur'an? Or are there locks upon their hearts? - Surah-Muhammad, 7: Ayat:24

These verses highlight the significance and accessibility of the Qur'an. Allah emphasizes that He has made the Qur'an
easy to understand, inviting people to reflect deeply on its messages. He describes it as the criterion, a clear guide that distinguishes between truth and falsehood. He also poses a rhetorical question, asking whether people are truly contemplating the Qur'an or if their hearts are locked, preventing them from understanding and accepting its guidance.

This channel shares my insights and reflections on the Qur'an, hoping to encourage others to embark on a similar journey.
